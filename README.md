# OPM-Logger

OPM(LiveGraphing).py logs data from the Newport Optical Power Meter over serial connection, as well as creates a live plot of our data. This code was used in the 2020 USAF AFWERX Base of the Future event in our virtual booth's technical breakout room. 

OPMVOA.py records logs data from the Newport Optical Power Meter over serial connection and controls a Variable Optical Attenuator at the same time. This allows you to set a desired OPM level which the the attenuator will adjust to keep it at. This is very important for protecting sensitive photo diodes.
